    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>1. Alert System Using IoT</h3>
      <p>This project TDS is essentially a measure of anything dissolved in water. when water encounters soluble material, particles of the material are absorbed into water, Creating total dissolved solids. TDS is the amount of organic and inorganic materials, such as metals, minerals, salts, and ions, dissolved per volume of water. real -time monitoring of TDS level in multiple water filter is crucial for ensuring water quality and good health. This project employs the real time data collection using TDS sensors and data is transmitted to a software called BLYNK app where it is analyzed and displayed through user interface. Alerts are generated for T DS levels exceeding predefined thresholds, facilitating timely maintenance and replacement of filters. The system enhances water quality management by providing immediate insights into filter performance, ensuring the delivery of clean and safe water. This approach demonstrates significant improvements in operational efficiency and water safety by enabling proactive responses to changes in TDS levels.</p>
